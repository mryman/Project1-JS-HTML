The purpose of this project is to integrate a HTML file with our donuts.html Javascript file so that input and output occur in a browser window for a user to interact with.

The user is initially presented with two buttons to select from.  The button labeled local will run the script with static data and output the statistics for the 5 stores.

If the user selects the custom button, the user is presented with 5 input boxes where they can put data for a store of their choice.  The script then uses this data to produce output in a similar fashion to the static store data.

Meaningful addition feature:
User can choose between a custom data set or the orignal stored data set.
User can click between the two even after initial choosing.

Known issues:
Doesn't have input validation checks.
